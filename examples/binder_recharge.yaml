# NOTE: This file uses an absolute path to the LigandMPNN runner and a conda env.
# If you do not have LigandMPNN locally, use `examples/binder_recharge_demo.yaml` instead.

# Example config for running with a local LigandMPNN installation.
# Install LigandMPNN here: https://github.com/dauparas/LigandMPNN/
# Edit `ligandmpnn_run_py` and `ligandmpnn_conda_env` below to match your setup.
